### Abstract 

Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable, progressive neurologicaldisease  that  cause  the  brain  to  shrink  and  brain  cells  to  die.  Earlierdetection of Alzheimer’s disease can lead to proper treatment and pre-vent brain tissue damage. So accurate and fast detection of Alzheimer ismost important. There is many well established model which can predictAlzheimer’s disease but they struggle hard for imbalance datasets. Thiswork has foused on the early and fast detection of Alzheimer’s diseasefrom Imbalance Brain Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) dataset usingproper Variational Autoencoder(VAE) model. Firstly, the whole datasethas been converted into a latent vector form then we used some popu-lar sampling methods to balance the dataset. Finally, we applied someclassification algorithm to classify the Brain MRI images into four dif-ferent classes‘Very Mild Demented’,‘Mild Demented’,‘Non Demented’and‘Moderate  Demented’.  In  order  to  maintain  the  stability  in  resultwe have applied 10-fold cross validation. In our experiment it indicatesimprovement in results to detect Alzheimer’s disease using VAE.
